********
Overview
********

Meta-optimizing semantic evolutionary search (MOSES) is a new approach to
program evolution, based on representation-building and probabilistic
modeling. MOSES has been successfully applied to solve hard problems in domains
such as computational biology, sentiment evaluation, and agent control. Results
tend to be more accurate, and require less objective function evaluations, in
comparison to other program evolution systems. Best of all, the result of
running MOSES is not a large nested structure or numerical vector, but a
compact and comprehensible program written in a simple Lisp-like
mini-language. For more information see http://metacog.org/doc.html .

********
The Code
********

The code for reproducing all of the published experiments on MOSES (see below)
may be found in the moses/ subdirectory. A more nicely architected and
performant implementation that is under active development may be found in the
moses2/ subdirectory. These two directories are completely independent and use
no common files (although identical versions of some files may be found in both
subdirectories).

************
Installation
************

Go into either moses/ or moses2/ (see above) and do 'make'. You will need to
have a recent gcc (4.x or late 3.x) and the boost libraries installed
(http://www.boost.org).
